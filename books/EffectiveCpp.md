# Effective C++
*50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*. First edition.

By Scott Meyers

I owe a lot to Scott Meyers' writing. Studying this book was a huge boost to my career. There are many ways to get into trouble with C++. Bjarne Stroustrup discusses in the ISO C++ FAQ the difference between legal and *moral* code. *Effective C++* exposed me to how to write moral code. In doing so, *Effective C++* also gave me a glimse into some of the lower level details of how C++ works. Ever since I got a taste for how C++ works under the hood, I have been eager to learn more.
